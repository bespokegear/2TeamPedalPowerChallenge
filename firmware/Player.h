// A Player is a person on a bike.
// A Player's bike's generator is hooked up to an analog input via a potential divider. 
// A Player has a load associated with them (in ohms)
// All players have the same vdiv resistances (from Config.h)
// All players have the same vref value (from Config.h)
// All players sampling is done at the same rate (from Config.h)
// All players sampler use the same alpha (smoothing) value (from Config.h)
// From this we can measure: instantaneous voltage, V, power = V*V / load
